"""Curve Finance permission hints for permission discovery.

Curve does NOT use the generic ``synthetic_swap_pair`` mechanism. Its pools
are pair-specific (StableSwap, CryptoSwap, Tricrypto), so a single pair only
resolves to one curated pool per chain — leaving every other registered pool
unauthorised on the Safe (#1903).

Curve owns its discovery vectors via ``build_discovery_vectors`` below —
see :func:`almanak.framework.permissions.hints.get_discovery_vectors_override`
for the dispatcher contract.

Synthetic-discovery participation (VIB-4928): ``SWAP`` only. Curve's compiler
can also build fungible LP, but synthetic Zodiac discovery deliberately omits
curve LP (its intent tests carry ``@pytest.mark.no_zodiac``), matching the
``build_discovery_vectors`` override below which returns ``None`` for non-SWAP.

    """Emit one synthetic ``SwapIntent`` per curated curve pool on ``chain``.

    Curve pools are pair-specific (StableSwap, CryptoSwap, Tricrypto), so a
    single token pair only resolves to one pool. ``CurveCompiler`` walks
    ``CURVE_POOLS[chain]`` to match pool by
    coin pair; emitting one intent per registered pool — using the first
    two coin addresses of each — guarantees every pool's address lands on
    the manifest.

    The price-oracle gate in ``CurveCompiler`` (price_ratio for
    CryptoSwap/Tricrypto pools) does NOT fire during permission discovery
    because ``IntentCompiler`` is created with ``allow_placeholder_prices=True``
    and ``_require_token_price`` returns the placeholder map (USDT=$1,
    WETH=$2000, WBTC=$45000, …) — every pool's coin pair resolves to a
    finite, positive price_ratio.

    No registered pool sets ``use_underlying`` today — polygon's aave-type
    am3pool was removed under VIB-5551 (frozen Aave V2 Polygon reserves made
    it non-executable); polygon's representative is now the frxUSD/USDT
    StableSwap-NG pool. If an aave-type pool is ever re-registered, the
    compiler routes to ``exchange_underlying`` automatically based on the
    pool's flags; no special-casing is needed here.

    Returns ``None`` for any ``intent_type`` other than ``SWAP`` so the
    framework default takes over for non-SWAP intents (curve only owns
    SWAP discovery today).
