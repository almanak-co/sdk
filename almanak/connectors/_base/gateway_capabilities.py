"""Gateway-side capability Protocols — gateway-side only.

Each ``Gateway*Capability`` is a ``@runtime_checkable`` Protocol that a
``GatewayConnector`` subclass declares it implements simply by defining
the matching method. The registry groups connectors by capability so the
gateway can dispatch capability-keyed calls without knowing about
specific protocols.

Phase 0 ships the three capabilities Phase 2 needs immediately:

* ``GatewayServicerCapability`` — connector ships its own gRPC servicer
  (Phase 2 callers: ``enso_service``, ``polymarket_service``).
* ``GatewayMarketLookupCapability`` — connector provides a token / market
  metadata lookup (Phase 2 callers: aave / compound / fluid / morpho /
  pendle / jupiter / beefy / yearn lookups).
* ``GatewayPoolKeyCacheCapability`` — connector builds the gateway's
  pool-key cache, including any pre-seeding (Phase 2 caller:
  ``uniswap_v4``). Supersedes the original ``GatewayPoolKeySeedCapability``
  (VIB-4810): folding "construct" + "seed" into one call lets
  ``MarketService`` hold the cache instance behind a structural Protocol
  (``PoolKeyCacheProtocol``) instead of importing a connector-specific
  cache class. The corresponding lookup-failure exception
  (``PoolKeyCacheError``) lives here so the gateway's ``except`` branch
  no longer imports a connector-specific error type either.

Phase 3 (VIB-4811) replaces the gateway's hardcoded protocol-keyed
dispatch tables with registry queries by adding:

* ``GatewayPoolHistoryCapability`` — connector publishes the chains on
  which its pool history is queryable.
* ``GatewayDefillamaSlugCapability`` — connector reports its DefiLlama
  project slug.
* ``GatewayFundingRateCapability`` — perp connector publishes per-market
  default rates + a funding-payment helper.
* ``GatewaySubgraphCapability`` — connector publishes alias → subgraph URL
  pairs for ``TheGraphIntegration``.
* ``GatewayPriceIdCapability`` — connector publishes CoinGecko +
  Dexscreener IDs for its protocol token(s).
* ``GatewayDexQuoteCapability`` — DEX connector publishes a quote
  function + supported chains.

Strategy-side code MUST NOT import this module.
